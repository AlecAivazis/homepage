Welcome to the third part in a series of posts on GraphQL Schema Federation. In this post
we will explore a performance optimization in our gateway that prevents the re-calculation
of query plans for repetitive queries.

While caching query plans does improve your API's performance, we will see that it also
enables us to create a list of approved queries, preventing user's from getting
creative with your API in unapproved ways.
